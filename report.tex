\section{Create an inverted index}

%compare the size of the dictionary and postings before and after lowercasing
% how much does stop words reduce the size of the index in terms of postings?

original

\section{Boolean queries}

% return the number of comparisons needed to perform the intersections

% measure the number of comparison steps after adding a query optimization feature

\section{Ranked queries}
% compute inverse document frequencies

%make a new file with term frequencies for each document and each term, from lowercased version

% compute TF/IDF for the query  

% compute cosine similarity measures for the documents you found using TF/IDF
